Prince|Welcome to Exiled!|0
Prince|I am the Prince, and I'll be walking you through this demo build.|0
Prince|As you've probably already noticed by now, you can left click or press the spacebar to advance the text.|3
Prince|In the future you will be able to save, load, and skip through read text.|5
Prince|But as of right now, none of that has been implemented yet...|2
Prince|Don't worry though, Kiernan is working on adding these features, and much more to the game!|3
Prince|In this build of the game, you can have characters talk and have images change as they talk.|0
Prince|You can see the format for how to do this in the SceneFormat.txt file. Try messing around with this yourself!|0
Prince|New to this build is the inclusion of Action Statements!|5
Prince|These statements will allow characters to perform various acitons, such as movements across the screen.|3
Prince|Face Left
Prince|In this build, characters can now change the direction that they are facing, like I just did.|0
Prince|Move Right
Prince|Characters can also move across the screen to set positions. This is me moving to the Right position.|0
Prince|Right now, the only positions that characters can move to are the positions Left and Right, however there are more being worked on.|0
Prince|A list of all of the positions that are being worked on can be found in the Positions.txt file.|0
Prince|That's all for this build!|0
Prince|The todo list for the next build is to expand upon the aciton statements by adding in more positions for the characters to move to.|0
Prince|This is on top of adding a statement that will allow you to instantly position a character at the position you specify.|0
Prince|Kiernan is also going to be working on adding a system to create menus that allow you to ask the player to make a choice in the future!|0
Prince|And after that's all done, it'll be moving onto creating a system to train skills and doing skill checks!|5
Prince|There will also be combat, building relationships with other characters, moving between towns and kingdoms...|5
Prince|But a lot of that stuff will be far off in the future.|4
Prince|Thanks for taking a look at this build of Exiled! I hope you enjoyed what's here so far.|3
